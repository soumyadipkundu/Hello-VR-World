Total Time to complete the project-2hr 30 min

One thing I liked about this project-
---------------------------------------

I like the day and night effects in unity, specially in a VR world!!



One thing that was challenging about this project-
----------------------------------------------------
well, it was my first project and I was totally struggling with this unity and android device for patching up!
it was not working properly and it will take 3 days to figure out how to fix that problem! In this course, it will be good if you put some sort of video about the SDK and JDK installation and end how to hook up with our phone!
